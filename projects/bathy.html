        Stony coral bed @ <a href="http://graysreef.noaa.gov/">Gray's Reef</a>. We used CARIS HIPS/SIPS and Base Editor to process the raw multibeam and sidescan sonar data; we then cross-referenced our processed imagery against previously collected data to see how the reef's morphology changed over time.

        This was an experiment recreating the visual style of <a href="
