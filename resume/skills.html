<h1>Skills</h1>

<article>
    <ul>
        <li>As a developer, my spirit animal is full-stack; I'm equally comfortable setting up Docker containers as I am building frontend components. </li>
        <li>I strive to write code that is clean, modular, and easy to understand. I don't do this for my own edification, but rather that of the person who comes after.</li>
        <li>I'm an avid listener and learner; I constantly push myself way past my comfort level in order to be the best I can at both.</li>
        <li>I built a profitable record store post-Napster, a profitable physical media distributor post-iPod/iTunes, and a profitable engineering consultancy without a website. I'm not intimidated by anything/anyone and thrive in finding value where others don't.</li>
        <li>I grew up on the beaches of California and South Carolina which for whatever reason, means I can get along with just about anyone.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        If you think the list above is more important than the list below, let's talk. While I'm entirely focused on writing code and doing science these days, I'm open to a compelling non-dev pitch.

    <ul>
        <li>Python (Django/DRF, Flask, Falcon, Kivy)</li>
        <li>Javascript (Node, ECMA5/6, React, Express, d3)</li>

        <li>Databases (Postgres, Mongo, MySQL, Neo4J, Riak)</li>
        <li>Clojure (requisite Lisp. I've yet to feel as cool as I was told I would be though)</li>
        <li>Swift (built and published a couple of small iOS apps)</li>
        <li>PM/Design (Sketch, Asana, Waffle, Photoshop, Jira, Pivotal Tracker)</li>
    </ul>
