        Hi, I'm Ryan.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm a geoscientist, software developer, (semi) professional surfer, and occasional investor. Depending on the year, I've also been an entrepreneur, journalist, urban escape trainer, baseball statistician, product manager, and other things I've stopped trying to fit a title to.
    </p>
    <p>
        I like to do/make interesting things and help others do the same.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've ererdone a lot more than I listed below. If you're curious or just want to have a chat, <a href="mailto:j.ryan.rembert@gmail.com">email</a> me or hit me up on <a href="https://twitter.com/jryanrembert">Twitter</a>.
