    <p>My school/work load was legit.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Finished 1-2 classes short of a minor in 10 different subjects and 3-4 classes short of degrees in Computer Science and Religious Studies.</li>
        <li>Far exceeded the maximum number of allowable credits every semester my final two years. I did this while participating in 1-2 independent research projects, TAing 4-6 classes, and working in the school's Space and Natural History museums and as a freelance software developer.</li>
        <li>In retrospect, the idea of not hitting it that hard terrifies me.</li>
    </ul>
