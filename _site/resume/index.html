    <p>
        Hi, I'm Ryan.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm a geoscientist, software developer, and (semi) professional surfer. Sometimes I'm also (or have been) an entrepreneur, journalist, teacher, wilderness survival trainer, baseball statistician, product manager, and other things I've stopped trying to fit a title to.
    </p>
    <p>
        All in all, I'm a battle-tested, unapologetic generalist that likes to do/make interesting things and help others do the same.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've done a lot more than I'm listing below. If you want to chat about that (or just in general), <a href="mailto:j.ryan.rembert@gmail.com">email</a> me or hit me up on <a href="https://twitter.com/jryanrembert">Twitter</a>.

            <h1>Skills</h1>

<article>
    <ul>
        <li>As a developer, my spirit animal is full-stack; I'm equally comfortable setting up Docker containers as I am building frontend components. </li>
        <li>I strive to write code that is clean, modular, and easy to understand. I don't do this for my own edification, but rather that of the person who comes after.</li>
        <li>I'm an avid listener and learner; I constantly push myself way past my comfort level in order to be the best I can at both.</li>
        <li>I built a profitable record store post-Napster, a profitable physical media distributor post-iPod/iTunes, and a profitable engineering consultancy without a website. I'm not intimidated by anything/anyone and thrive in finding value where others don't.</li>
        <li>I grew up on the beaches of California and South Carolina which for whatever reason, means I can get along with just about anyone.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        If you think the list above is more important than the list below, let's talk. While I'm entirely focused on writing code and doing science these days, I'm open to a compelling non-dev pitch.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Python (Django/DRF, Flask, Falcon, Kivy)</li>
        <li>Javascript (Node, ECMA5/6, React, Express, d3)</li>
        <li>Geospatial (GDAL/OGR, Mapbox, Leaflet, Turf, ArcGIS, QGIS, d3)</li>
        <li>DevOps (nginx, AWS, Heroku, Google App Engine, Gulp, Webpack, Vagrant, Puppet, TravisCI)</li>
        <li>Databases (Postgres, Mongo, MySQL, Neo4J, Riak)</li>
        <li>Clojure (requisite Lisp. I've yet to feel as cool as I was told I would be though)</li>
        <li>Swift (built and published a couple of small iOS apps)</li>
        <li>PM/Design (Sketch, Asana, Waffle, Photoshop, Jira, Pivotal Tracker)</li>
    </ul>
