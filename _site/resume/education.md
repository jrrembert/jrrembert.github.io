    <p>My school/work load was legit.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Finished 1-2 classes short of a minor in 10 different subjects and 3-4 classes short of degrees in Computer Science and Religious Studies.</li>
        <li>Exceeded the maximum number of allowable credits every semester my final two years. I did this while participating in 2-3 independent research projects and TAing 4-6 classes each semester, working in the school's Space and Natural History museums, and maintaining a freelance software consultancy.</li>
        <li>Fun fact: the school had to alter their advising software to fit the number of advisors I had (5).
        <li>In retrospect, the idea of not hitting it that hard terrifies me.</li>
    </ul>
