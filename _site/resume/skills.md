    <ul>
        <li>I built a profitable record store post-Napster, a profitable physical media distributor post-iPod/iTunes, and a profitable engineering consultancy without a website. Market building, product design, and unconventionality are in my DNA.</li>
        <li>As a developer, my spirit animal is full-stack; I'm equally comfortable setting up Docker containers as I am building frontend components. </li>
        <li>I strive to write code that is clean, modular, and easy to understand. I don't do this for my own edification, but rather that of the person who comes after.</li>
        <li>The happiness of my friends and colleagues come first. I do not compromise on this for anyone, or any product.</li>
        <li>I grew up on the beaches of California and South Carolina which for whatever reason, means I can get along with just about anyone.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        If you think the list above is more important than the list below, let's talk. While I'm entirely focused on writing code and doing science these days, I'm open to a compelling non-dev pitch over coffee.
