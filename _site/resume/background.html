<h1>Background</h1>

<article>
    <p>
        Hi, I'm Ryan.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm a geoscientist, software developer, and (semi) professional surfer. Sometimes I'm also (or have been) an entrepreneur, journalist, teacher, wilderness survival trainer, baseball statistician, product manager, and other things I've stopped trying to fit a title to.
    </p>
    <p>
        All in all, I'm a battle-tested, unapologetic generalist that likes to do/make interesting things and help others do the same.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've done a lot more than I'm listing below. If you want to chat about that (or just in general), <a href="mailto:j.ryan.rembert@gmail.com">email</a> me or hit me up on <a href="https://twitter.com/jryanrembert">Twitter</a>.
